With more than 10 years of exhaustive experience for various industries and with experience in complex most structures ranging from Enterprise B2B / B2C solutions including Open Source and explicit custom coded solutions for North American customers. For the past 10 years I've managed various teams across the globe as a project manager as well as chief architect with over 400 medium to large sized project managed and coded - all for international clients. I've worked with almost every API on the web, I've worked with (almost) every E-commerce solution, every LMS / E-Learning Platform, every single IDX/ MLS Property Feed, every social platform APIs and every project management / code management system.
